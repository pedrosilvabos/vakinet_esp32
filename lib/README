IoT ESP32 Project — README

Project Overview:
This project is focused on developing an IoT solution using ESP32-based hardware to remotely monitor sensor data (initially accelerometer and temperature) with planned GPS integration and solar-powered battery management. The goal is a robust, low-power device capable of reliable data transmission via MQTT and HTTP protocols, designed for eventual deployment on specialized LilyGo boards with LoRa, GPS, and solar charging.

What We’ve Agreed & Brainstormed:

    GPS Hot Start & Caching:
    We’ll rely on existing GPS libraries for ephemeris/almanac caching (hot start). This will be implemented once the LilyGo hardware arrives. Caching data will be stored in RAM initially; if memory is insufficient, we’ll use SD card or cloud backup.

    Battery & Solar Management:
    We need an MPPT solar charge controller for proper battery charging capped at ~80%. Battery monitoring will be integrated in firmware after hardware arrives.

    Battery Configuration:
    Two LiPo batteries in parallel are planned, but this is pending hardware delivery.

    Sensor Sampling Intervals:
    A baseline of approximately 120 seconds between sensor reads and transmissions has been agreed.

    Data Caching & Storage:
    Start with RAM caching of data to handle transmission failures or delays; scale to SD card or cloud backup if needed.

    Power Optimization:
    Plan to implement deep sleep cycles to minimize power draw between readings and transmissions.

    OTA Updates:
    Will be added after core functions like sensor reading, data transmission, and power management are stable.

Current Status:

    Running on a standard ESP32 board (no LilyGo yet) with mock sensor data.

    Data transmission over MQTT and HTTP is functional and tested.

    No real sensor sampling, battery monitoring, or solar panel integration yet.

    GPS hot start and caching discussed and planned, but not implemented due to lack of hardware.

    Hardware for full implementation ordered and pending delivery.

Hardware Ordered:

    LILYGO® TTGO Meshtastic T-Beam V1.2 ESP32 LoRa Dev Board (868MHz, OLED)

    7.4V 12000mAh Li-ion Battery with XH2.54 connector

    5x BMA400 3-axis Accelerometer Modules

    LILYGO TTGO T-SIM7600E-L1C 4G LTE ESP32 Board with solar charging

    LoRa 868/915 MHz Accessories Shield for T-SIM7000G ESP32-WROVER-B

    Waterproof DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

    Miscellaneous accessories (door lock hooks, etc.)

Next Steps:

    Receive and integrate LilyGo boards and sensors.

    Implement GPS ephemeris caching and hot start using available libraries.

    Develop battery monitoring and MPPT solar charging firmware.

    Replace mock sensor data with real sensor sampling.

    Add power-saving features (deep sleep).

    Plan OTA update infrastructure.

    Possibly implement SD card storage or cloud backup for cached data.

Prompt to Update ChatGPT with Project Context:

Here is the current status and context of my IoT + ESP32 project:

- We have brainstormed and discussed these key topics, with agreed outcomes:

  1. GPS hot start and ephemeris caching: Using existing GPS libraries; caching will be implemented once LilyGo hardware arrives, leveraging available memory or external SD card.

  2. Battery monitoring and MPPT solar charging: MPPT solar charge controller required; firmware battery management to be added after hardware availability.

  3. Battery configuration: Two LiPo batteries in parallel planned, implementation deferred until hardware arrives.

  4. Sensor sampling intervals: ~120 seconds between samples agreed as baseline.

  5. Data caching and storage: Start with RAM caching; consider SD card or cloud backup if needed.

  6. Power optimization: Deep sleep cycles between readings and transmissions planned.

  7. OTA updates: Future addition after core functions stabilize.

- Hardware ordered includes: LILYGO TTGO Meshtastic T-Beam V1.2 ESP32 LoRa Board, 7.4V 12000mAh Li-ion battery, 5x BMA400 accelerometers, LILYGO T-SIM7600E-L1C 4G LTE ESP32 board with solar charging, LoRa accessories shield, DS18B20 temperature sensor, and other accessories.

- Current implementation status: Running on regular ESP32 with mock sensor data; real sensor sampling, battery monitoring, solar panel integration, and GPS caching are planned next steps.
